# Scrum Organization for Huffman Compressor Project

This document outlines a Scrum framework for organizing the development of the Huffman Compressor project. It details the key Scrum artifacts and how they can be managed, with a focus on using a Trello board for visualization and tracking.

## 1. Scrum Roles (Brief Overview)

*   **Product Owner:** Defines and prioritizes the Product Backlog, ensuring it maximizes value.
*   **Scrum Master:** Facilitates Scrum events, coaches the team, and removes impediments.
*   **Development Team:** Self-organizing and cross-functional individuals responsible for delivering a "Done" Increment.

## 2. Scrum Events (Brief Overview)

*   **Sprint Planning:** The team plans the work to be performed in the Sprint.
*   **Daily Scrum:** A 15-minute time-boxed event for the Development Team to synchronize activities and create a plan for the next 24 hours.
*   **Sprint Review:** The team inspects the Increment and adapts the Product Backlog if needed.
*   **Sprint Retrospective:** The team inspects itself and creates a plan for improvements to be enacted during the next Sprint.

## 3. Scrum Artifacts and Trello Board Mapping

We will use a Trello board to visualize and manage the Scrum artifacts. Below is a suggested structure:

### 3.1. Product Backlog

**Definition:** An ordered list of everything that might be needed in the product. It is dynamic and constantly evolving.

**Trello Mapping:**
*   **List Name:** `Product Backlog`
*   **Card Type:** User Stories, Features, Epics, Technical Debt, Bugs.
*   **Card Content:** Each card represents a backlog item. It should include:
    *   **Title:** A concise description (e.g., "As a user, I want to compress a file so that I can save space").
    *   **Description:** Detailed requirements, acceptance criteria, and any relevant notes.
    *   **Labels:** Categorization (e.g., `Feature`, `Bug`, `Technical Debt`, `High Priority`).
    *   **Due Date (Optional):** For high-level targets.
    *   **Members (Optional):** If a specific person is responsible for refining it.

### 3.2. Sprint Backlog

**Definition:** The set of Product Backlog items selected for the Sprint, plus the plan for delivering the Increment and realizing the Sprint Goal.

**Trello Mapping:**
*   **List Names:**
    *   `Sprint X (To Do)`: Items committed for the current sprint, ready to be worked on.
    *   `In Progress`: Items currently being worked on by team members.
    *   `Review/Testing`: Items completed by a developer and awaiting review or testing.
*   **Card Type:** Tasks (derived from Product Backlog items).
*   **Card Content:** Each card represents a task needed to complete a Product Backlog item. It should include:
    *   **Title:** A specific task (e.g., "Implement Huffman tree construction").
    *   **Description:** Technical details, sub-tasks, or links to relevant code sections.
    *   **Labels:** (e.g., `Backend`, `Frontend`, `Testing`).
    *   **Members:** Assignee for the task.
    *   **Checklists:** For breaking down tasks into smaller, trackable steps.

### 3.3. Increment

**Definition:** The sum of all Product Backlog items completed during a Sprint and the value of the increments of all previous Sprints. It must be "Done," meaning usable and potentially releasable.

**Trello Mapping:**
*   **List Name:** `Done`
*   **Card Type:** Completed Product Backlog items.
*   **Card Content:** When a Product Backlog item (and all its associated tasks) is completed and meets the Definition of Done, its card is moved to this list. This list represents the shippable product increment.

## 4. Suggested Trello Board Structure

Your Trello board could have the following lists, from left to right:

1.  **Product Backlog:** All potential work for the project.
2.  **Sprint X (To Do):** Work committed for the current sprint.
3.  **In Progress:** Work currently being actively developed.
4.  **Review/Testing:** Work completed by development, awaiting review or QA.
5.  **Done:** Completed and "Done" work for the current sprint.
6.  **Archived Sprints (Optional):** A list for completed sprint goals or a separate board for historical sprints.

**Example Card Flow:**

`Product Backlog` -> (During Sprint Planning) -> `Sprint X (To Do)` -> (Developer picks up) -> `In Progress` -> (Developer finishes) -> `Review/Testing` -> (Reviewed/Tested and Done) -> `Done`

This setup provides a clear visual workflow for your Scrum team and helps manage the project's progress effectively.
