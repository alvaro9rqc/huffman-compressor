https://chatgpt.com/c/686d7ee7-b3e8-8004-8698-3f2ccea78a0d
Below is a list of suggested product backlog cards for your Huffman Compressor project, formatted for easy transfer to a Trello board. Each card includes a title, a detailed description, and suggested labels.

---

## User Stories / Features

### Card: As a user, I want to compress a file so that I can save storage space.

**Description:** Implement the core functionality to take an input file, apply Huffman encoding, and produce a compressed output file. This involves frequency analysis, Huffman tree construction, and bit-level writing.

**Labels:** `Feature`, `Core Functionality`, `High Priority`

---

### Card: As a user, I want to decompress a compressed file so that I can restore the original data.

**Description:** Implement the functionality to read a Huffman-compressed file, reconstruct the Huffman tree (from metadata in the compressed file), and decode the bitstream back into the original file content.

**Labels:** `Feature`, `Core Functionality`, `High Priority`

---

### Card: As a user, I want to see the compression ratio after compression so that I can evaluate its effectiveness.

**Description:** After a file is compressed, calculate and display the compression ratio (original size vs. compressed size). This should be presented in a user-friendly format (e.g., percentage reduction).

**Labels:** `Feature`, `Reporting`, `Medium Priority`

---

### Card: As a user, I want to handle various file types (text, binary) so that I can compress different kinds of data.

**Description:** Ensure the compressor can correctly process both text files (e.g., `.txt`, `.c`, `.h`) and binary files (e.g., `.jpg`, `.pdf`). This might involve careful handling of byte streams and character sets.

**Labels:** `Feature`, `Compatibility`, `Medium Priority`

----- Card: As a user, I want to specify input and output file paths via command line arguments so that I can easily automate compression/decompression.

**Description:** Implement command-line argument parsing for specifying the input file, output file, and operation mode (compress/decompress). For example: `huffman -c input.txt output.huf` or `huffman -d input.huf output.txt`.

**Labels:** `Feature`, `CLI`, `High Priority`

---

### Card: As a developer, I want a robust error handling mechanism so that the application behaves predictably on invalid input or operations.

**Description:** Implement comprehensive error handling for scenarios such as file not found, invalid file format, insufficient permissions, memory allocation failures, etc. Provide clear error messages to the user.

**Labels:** `Feature`, `Technical`, `Error Handling`, `High Priority`

---

### Card: As a user, I want to see progress indicators for large files so that I know the application is still working.

**Description:** For very large files, implement a simple progress indicator (e.g., percentage complete, spinning cursor) during compression and decompression to provide feedback to the user.

**Labels:** `Feature`, `UX`, `Low Priority`

---

### Card: As a user, I want to compress/decompress multiple files in a directory so that I can process batches of data.

**Description:** Extend the CLI to support processing multiple files or an entire directory. This could involve iterating through files and applying the compression/decompression operation to each.

**Labels:** `Feature`, `Batch Processing`, `Low Priority`

---

## Technical Debt / Refactoring

### Card: Refactor Huffman tree construction for better modularity and readability.

**Description:** Review and refactor the existing Huffman tree construction logic (`huffman.c`, `huffman.h`) to improve code organization, reduce complexity, and enhance readability. Ensure clear separation of concerns.

**Labels:** `Technical Debt`, `Refactoring`, `Code Quality`

---

### Card: Optimize priority queue implementation for performance.

**Description:** Analyze the current `priority_queue.c` implementation. If performance bottlenecks are identified, explore and implement more efficient data structures or algorithms for the priority queue (e.g., binary heap).

**Labels:** `Technical Debt`, `Performance`, `Optimization`

---

### Card: Improve I/O operations for efficiency with large files.

**Description:** Review `io_tool.c` for potential I/O bottlenecks when handling very large files. Consider implementing buffered I/O or other techniques to improve read/write performance.

**Labels:** `Technical Debt`, `Performance`, `I/O`

---

## Bugs (Placeholder)

### Card: Investigate potential memory leaks during long compression/decompression runs.

**Description:** Conduct memory profiling to identify and fix any memory leaks that might occur, especially when processing large files or running the application for extended periods.

**Labels:** `Bug`, `Memory`, `High Priority`

---

### Card: Fix incorrect handling of empty input files.

**Description:** Ensure the compressor/decompressor gracefully handles empty input files without crashing or producing corrupted output. Define expected behavior and implement it.

**Labels:** `Bug`, `Edge Case`, `Medium Priority`

---

### Card: Decompression fails for files compressed on a different endian system.

**Description:** Investigate if the current implementation correctly handles endianness differences when compressing and decompressing files across different systems. If not, implement a solution to ensure cross-platform compatibility.

**Labels:** `Bug`, `Compatibility`, `Endianness`
